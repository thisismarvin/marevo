## ABOUT BOLOGNA PROCESS AND ECTS IN UKRAINE

A couple of years have passed since Ukraine had started to implement the ECTS
and the Bologna Process in the national education. There's not a news that it
went down from the beginning, as some of the most important rules declared by
ECTS had not been implemented. The first problem is that Ukrainian educational
institutions did not migrate to the ECTS-marking (with dynamic ranging, etc)
but just joined the 5-mark national system (or even 12-mark own systems) with
the new 100-mark system and set up the ranges for lettered marks (A from 91 to
100, etc). Even more, each university has implemented this mutated system by
its own, so there's not a universal marking system in Ukrainian high schools.

## TROUBLESHOOTING ABOUT ECTS IN UKRAINE

There's still one more problem in Ukrainian educational area about ECTS. Even
if Ukraine did implement it right - there could happen some other troubles.
For instance, the problem of divisioning in the ECTS distribution. In Europe,
there's a good practice of pre-building groups of students in amount that fit
to the ECTS ranges in distribution (it means - they could be integers when the
whole amount of students is divided by 10%, 25%, etc). Though, this practice
will not predict all possible troubles, such as amount of students in F and FX
ranges (which are not percentaged). If so, there could happen a situation when
the ECTS ranges would not be integers (e.g., 5.4 'students' in 'A' range). It
is not a valid distribution, so it requires some changes for the basic ECTS
distribution. The aim of such changes is to minimize the level of deviations
from the basic ECTS distribution (minimize the 'collisions').

## ABOUT MAREVO

The MAREVO project is a tool that determined for help in implementing the ECTS
in Ukraine. It allows user to build a valid ECTS distrubition and choose a way
of minimizing deviations. This programme also supports the national 5-mark
system of Ukraine and could be extended with any other marking system that's
compatible with the 100-mark ECTS system.
The name of MAREVO project means 'Marking Evolution', which was its first name
when the programme was just a part of scientific work.
